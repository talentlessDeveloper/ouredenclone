      "Easy. We're bringing the convenience of room service to homes across Africa – but starting with Lagos. Home tasks are routine activities that should be outsourced, so you can focus on the things with the most impact in your life. It could be making time for work that matters, or for enjoyment. You deserve to live well without the extra effort. Some people call us the Concierge of Comfort – they're correct.",

    title: "How does it work?",
    content:
      "When you sign up on Eden, you can configure a plan that fits your needs, then you get assigned a Gardener to help you manage your home. The app takes your food, laundry, and home cleaning needs and turns them into tasks that our Gardeners attend to on schedule. The only finger you'll be lifting is the one scrolling through the app, monitoring progress.",

    title: "Who are Gardeners?",
    content:
      "Your Home Managers. They’re the human side of Eden: carefully-screened people (we run full background checks on all Gardeners) who are trained to handle your home requests with ease and enthusiasm. Our Gardeners fit a profile. They’re detail-oriented, responsive, responsible and friendly. They have one job, and that job is to understand what the perfect home means for you specifically, then work every day to provide you with exactly that.When you sign up on Eden, you see a profile of your Gardener, and you can get an impression of them before they start handling your chores.

    title: "How much are they good for?",
    content:
      "A lot. Think of your Gardener as your link to an ever-expanding world of Eden services you can take advantage of. Your Gardener helps you access services like meals, house cleaning (standard and deep cleaning), and laundry services. And that's just the beginning.If there’s ever a service you wish your Gardener provided (that they don’t, as yet), select the ‘Feedback’ option on the Gardener profile, and we’ll get the message! ",

    title: "Does my Gardener handle just my Eden account?",
    content:
      "Your Gardener’s schedule is designed to give the best attention to your chores, which gives them (based on our very trusty Eden math) enough time to attend to a few other customers in the same area as you. This means that our Gardeners attend to a handful of customers, but are never swamped with requests. ",
